	Complex data list (need to figure out)  **** Iterates over a list of data and if any 1 of 4 indices (checks 4 at a time) contain a non zero value then log all 4 of em ****

	numArray is the data list passed in 
		[0] => unknown 3
		[1] => 0
		[2] => unknown 6
		[3] => effect count  => uint => 32 bit max

		sequence of 4's
			[0] => Effect id + (unknown1 << 6) + (effect index << 24) => stored as uint so all packed
				Effect is a ushort 
				Unknown1 is a byte
				Effect index is a byte
			[1] => uint unknown 2 + uint (unknown 3 << 16)
			[2] => duration in bytes to uint32 => duration is a float converted to bytes then to an uint so we need to go to uint -> float
			[3] => actor id => player id

	Effect result will trigger a Network buff to come right after it (not 100% sure, but from source code it looks like it)

	for (int index = 0; index < (int) num1; ++index)
      {
        numArray[4 + index * 4] = (uint) ((int) effects[index].EffectID + ((int) effects[index].unknown1 << 6) + ((int) effects[index].EffectIndex << 24));
